   <p>Crispmas was almost upon the citizens of Cocoa Land. It was a time for fabulous festivities, fantastic food and
   of course floods and floods of fun. However, just like summer, the Cocoanians had to be suitably armoured to protect themselves from the wild winter weather.
   Crispmas was very like your human Christmas except for one major difference. Each year, at the same time and on the same date, each citizen would break out in orange freckles. These were not just your ordinary,
   run of the mill freckles, these freckles had a crispy coating designed to protect the Cocoanians’ sensitive chocolate bodies from shattering when the icy winter windss roared.</p>

   <p>So, on the first of December at 10am every year, you could hear each crispy freckle popping up on all the feet, faces, bellies, backs and legs of each person in Cocoa Land. The noise would echo across the land like the sound of a million people popping bubble wrap at the same time. It was so loud that people would cover their ears with ear muffs to drown out the noise. This yearly event was known to all as ‘The Popping.’<img src="IMG/popping.png" alt="pic of penguin wishing ppl a happy popping." style="float:right;">
    
   <p>Every person in Cocoa Land started work and school later than usual due to this yearly popping process. Princess Cocoa loved starting school later. This was the one and only positive of The Popping. Every other aspect annoyed her immensely. The main reason she despised The Popping was that she no longer had
   her lovely, smooth, chocolate complexion. Instead, she had this rough crispy outer layer. She no longer had the ‘royal’ glow on her chocolate cheeks which, aside from her beautiful attire and impeccable manners, made her stand out from the vulgar, smelly ‘common’ folk of Cocoa Land, she thought.</p>
    
   <p>She complained to her mother, the Queen, asking her why she should have the same coloured crispy freckles as all the commoners in Cocoa Land. <blockquote>'Surely the royal crispy freckles should be a different colour.
   Surely the royal crispy freckles or creckles as they were often called, should be of a glistening gold or even an elegant emerald green to reflect their superiority.'</blockquote>
    
   <p>Her mother explained that the royal family were no different to the citizens of Cocoa Land. She
   continued, <blockquote>‘My dear child, we are all the same. We may live in this magnificent palace however we are no
   better than anybody else. We all breathe and think and feel. We all desire to give love and be loved. We all
   ope the best for our families and friends. My dear, we would not be living in this palace if not for the citizens
   of Cocoa Land.'</blockquote>
    
   <p>Princess Cocoa decided that her mother must have been overcome by some fever to utter such ridiculous things, to say that the Cocoanians in some way helped her family to live in their royal palace. She quickly questioned this with a red face and a furrowed brow. <blockquote>‘WHAT!!!! How have THEY helped us?? We don’t need THEIR help!!!’</blockquote>
      
   <p>The queen went on to explain to the princess that the citizens pay taxes out of their earnings each week and these taxes are then given to the royal family. Some of these taxes ensure the upkeep of the palace as well as the well-being of the royal family. The rest of the taxes went back into the country and funded public education, the public health care system, the repair of public roads and public buildings and the general upkeep and smooth running of Cocoa Land.</p>
      
   <p>Princess Cocoa was disgusted and responded with further redness in her cheeks and further furrowedness of her brow. <blockquote>‘You mean that WE do not keep all these so-called taxes. You mean the common people pay us for all the hard work we do and then WE give them back some of that money. That’s terribly unfair mama. We NEED that money. I mean look at this dress I’m wearing. There are only 100 rubies on this dress. I could have 200 rubies on this dress if we didn’t stupidly and senselessly give it back to THOSE people.’</blockquote>
      
   <p>After spitting and spluttering in complete and utter ANGER and FURY and after calling the people of Cocoa Land every bad name under the sun, princess Cocoa decided that her mother had clearly gone INSANE!! She had caught the kindness bug and princess Cocoa was unsure how she could cure her of this horrendous affliction. Her mother was clearly a lost cause. She had been lost to the illness of compassion and decency. Princess Cocoa hoped, above all, that it was not contagious.</p>
    
   <p>The determined princess would have to take things into her own chocolatey hands. She decided she would dress up as a commoner and walk through the
   cobbled streets of Cocoa Land taking back what she was owed.</p>
