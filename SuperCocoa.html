    <p>Princess Cocoa, although a princess, never had the luxury of watching television. Her parents believed the best source of entertainment was her own imagination and the vast array of books on the palace library. Princess Cocoa resented her parents for this and everytime she walked passed the library she would spit at the large, oak library doors.</p>
    

    <p>One day, as Princess Cocoa was skipping briskly passed the housekeeper's quarters (on one of her amazing Palace adventures) she heard some strange noises. She peeked through the door and to her shock and excitement the housekeeper's grand-daughter, Poppett, was watching a superhero cartton while her grand-mother was tending to the palace duties. Princess Cocoa had never seen these superheroes in action before, she just heard about them from her school mates, or school colleagues as she called them.</p>
    
    <p>There was one in particular who caught the princess' eye - a fiery red-haired hero. She had never seen such flaming locks before and was compeltely and utterly mesmerised. So mesmerised in fact that she didn't realise that Poppett was now holding her hand. Princess Cocoa, disgusted by common person contact, quickly shook Poppett's hand off in disdain and quickly ran off.</p>
    
    <p>Princess Cocoa went about her day trying to mimic the behaviour and actions of this fiery superhero. The first thing she simply had to do was dye her chocolate brown locks. She rooted through her mother's make-up drawer but found nothing. She attempted to reach her mother's red nail colouring on the top shelf of the batghroom cabinet but she fell and chipped a toe. She then turned her attention to the kitchen and came across a punnet of fresh, juicy, red strawberries. And so, with no other options left, Princess Cocoa glued each red strawberry to her chocolatey head. The juices dribbled down her face in a sticky mess but, according to the Princess, she looked absolutely amazing.</p><img src="IMG/superhero.png" alt="image of a Princess Cocoa dressed as a superhero." style="float:left;width:300px;height:400px;">
    
    <p>With her hair sorted, she attempted the stunts the superheroes performed. She leaped off the royal slide pretending to fly. She spun like a twister thinking if she only went fast enough she would disappesr into thin air like the superheroes. She attempted back flips but she ended up on her chocolate behind. She also tried talking to animals. Unfortunately for Cocoa, the royal dog, Gwegooey or Gooey for short, was so surprised  by the Princess' sudden attemtion towards him he just could not stop licking her face with affection. He licked her so much that he ended up licking her nose off, but at least the strawberry sticky mess was now gone.</p>
    
    <p>After Cocoa had quick reconstructive nose moulding surgery, she rapidly returned to her mission. She thought in order to become a superhero, she must save someone's life. Much to Cocoa's disappointment, however, nobody in the palace needed help or saving. In fact, everybody was safe and happy. <q class="PCquote">How <strong>selfish</strong> of the world,</q> she muttered angrily.</p>
    
    <p>The Princess took matters into her own hands. She asked herself what she could do in order to become a superhero in the least amount of time and with minimum effort. <q>OF COURSE!!! THE CROWN JEWELS!!!</q> she shouted. Luckily for her, nobody heard her. Princess Cocoa was going to <strong>DUN DUN DUN........... STEAL THE CROWN JEWELS!!!</strong> Once in possession of the jewels, she would sound the alarm and just when everyone was about to give up, she would save the day by finding the jewels and restoring them to their rightful place.</p><p><img src="IMG/crown-1539630_1920%20(1).png" alt="image of a royal crown." style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;"></p>
    
    <p>The crown jewels were a magnificent and beautiful sight. They were made of the world renowned and specially crafted jelly babies. Each jelly baby having a different facial expression to signify the array of human emotion and how the royal family were connected to all the emotions and feelings of all the citizens in Cocoa Land. Each jelly baby was also crystalised with the sparkliest of sugar and so they shone like a million dazzling stars in the night sky.</p>
    
    <p>Of all days, this was the worst day for the crown jewels to go missing. The Queen was hosting a banquet for the royal family of the neighbouring land, The United Lakes of Jamerica. If the queen was not wearing the crown it would be seen as a mark of disrespect to the Jamerican royal family and in particular the royal prince, Barack Ojama. Further more, if she was to explain that her crown jewels had been stolen by one of her subjects then prince Ojama might think less of her leadership. He might think that she was not respected by the citizens of Cocoa Land. So, when Princess Cocoa sounded the alarm about the stolen jewels. the once cheery palace descended into chaos. <q>THE JEWELS MUST BE FOUND!!!</q> There was simply no time to spare.</p>
    
    <p>The queen called in the most intelligent and talented detective in all the land, Sir Choc Caramel Combs. Sir Choc was a very tall and striking middle aged man with a unique head of snow white hair. He began his detective work by interrogatimng all the palace staff but failed to question the princerss. She, of course, could not possibly be the culprit. The princess was almost offended that he did not think her so devious, but then she remembered the mission in hand. <q>I must save the day and restore the jewels,</q> she reminded herself. She had to forget about her dislike of Sir Choc. As she was thinking this, she had the most stupendous of ideas. She would get her own back on this so called 'expert detective.'</p>
    <p class=theEnd><a href="#topPage" style="float:right;">Back to Top</a></p><br>
    
    <p>The princess offered to take Sir Choc's coat. Everybody, even Sir Choc, was overwhelmed by the princess' kindness and humility. Little did he know what the princess was actually up to.</p>
    
    <p>Now, you may think it strange that the princess took the detective's coat?? You see, it was all a part of her shrewd, little plan. Asd I mentioned before, Sir Choc had an unusual condition which affected him and him alone. That head of white hair was actually coconout shavings sprouting from his scalp. This condition baffled the choctors of Cocoa Land, but Sir Choc used it to his advantage. He claimed it was a sign of his uniqueness and it was prrof that he was some sort of god or made up of a super cocoa bean. He was different from all the common people, not only in imntelligence but also in appearance. These coconut shavings fell from his almighty head and onto his coat shoulders making a layer of coconut druff.</p>
    
    <p>While Sir Choc was questioning the staff, Princess Cocoa snuck off to retrieve the hidden jewels. She had cleverly hidden the jewels in the back of the queen's toilet. She knew nobody would think of checking there because everybody knew the queen had notoriously stinky poos and so her royal bathroom was only cleaned once a month. For healtgh and <img src="IMG/toilet.png" alt="image of toilet paper." style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;"> safety reasons, they had to bring in professional cleaners who were used to dealing with strong gasses, and who had the necessary equipment - gas masks and power hoses for example. Fortunately for Cocoa, she was immune to her mother's stink.</p>
    
    <p>Princess Cocoa placed the jewels in the boot of Sir Choc's car and then put an incriminating trail of sugar crystals from the boot towards the queen's royal bedroom. The princess also used the cocnut druff from Sherchoc's coat and placed a few around the crown's caramel encrusted case. She then deviously sprinkled some crystals on Sir Choc's coat.</p>
    
    <p>With all the evidence planted, the princess sprinted to her mpther and discreetly revealed the sugar crystals on Sir Choc's clothing. The queen immediately called for Sir Choc and all of his belongings to be thoroughly searched. Suffice to say, his car was also searched, the jewels found and the trail of sugar shone a bright, guilty light on the on the infamous and once celebrated Sir Choc Caramel Combs.</p>
    
    <p>Princess Cocoa was the hero of the hour and as Sir Choc was being thrown behind bars, princess Cocoa was soaking up all the praise in the palace. Little did she know that, in becoming a super hero and saving the day, she also gained an arch enemy. Sir Choc Caramel Combs was already plotting his escape and revenge on the cruel princess. This was not the end of Super Cocoa VERSUS Sir Choc Caramel Combs!!</p></div>
