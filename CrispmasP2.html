    <h2>Crispmas</h2>
    <h2>Part Two</h2>
    <p><img src="IMG/XMASCOCOA.png" alt="drawing of Princess Cocoa with Xmas hat." style="float:left;width:250px;height:400px;"></p>  

    <p>One frosty weekend the princess warned everyone in the palace that she was going to her bedroom
    to spend a few hours looking at herself in the mirror and she further warned that she was not to be disturbed.
    Everyone agreed and did not think this strange as the princess would do this on a regular basis. Having tricked
    everyone in the palace, she then went on the lookout for a disguise. She found a large winter coat belonging to
    her housemaid, Bubbles. Bubbles was rather round and so her coat was perfect as it was large and had four
    huge pockets, two inside the coat and two outside. These pockets would be perfect for stashing all the goodies
    she was planning to steal. It also had a large hood which would aid the princess in concealing her identity. The
    princess snuck out of the palace dressed as her housemaid Bubbles and headed straight for <img src="IMG/xmastree.png" alt="image of tree at Xmas." style="float:right;width:500px;height:600px;">the town for the
    Crispmas markets.

    
    <p>The town was a hive of activity with all the Cocoanians purchasing their Crispmas gifts and food from
    the market stalls. There were a variety of delicious smells floating through the winter air - fresh bread,
    cranberry and pomegranate jams, mint sauces, hazelnut and honey butter to name a few. Princess Cocoa
    headed straight for the bread stall and sneakily slipped three large baguettes into one of Bubbles’ HUMUNGOUS
    pockets. She then made a bee line for the honey butter stall and slipped 5 jars of honey heaven into the other
    ginormous pocket. She glided from stall to stall filling her pockets believing that this was pay back for the taxes
    that were cruelly taken from her family.</p>
    
    <p>As she was about to hit the last stall which was the fruity jam stall, she 
    was met by a tall, slim, angry looking man who pulled down her hood and exclaimed <blockquote>‘I have been watching
    you, missy. You have been extremely busy!!!!!’ </blockquote>
       
    <p>As he said this he grabbed one long baguette out of her pocket
    and stared at her with his small, squinty eyes waiting impatiently for an answer.
    Princess Cocoa was so annoyed at herself that she had been caught red handed. She was about to
    exclaim <q>‘DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM,’</q> but quickly changed her mind as she was afraid the common folk, in
    discovering her true identity, would capture her and hold her for ransom. She was petrified she would be held
    hostage in one of their small, stinky, dingy huts and would have to sleep on their dirty, dusty floors.</p> 
       
    <p>For once, she was happy that she had the creckles as they helped her hide her royal identity. As the man continued to shout at her she looked around trying to find an escape route. Her escape plan was brought to a halt, however, when a young Cocoanian girl appeared and asked the man in a calm and reasonable voice to stop bellowing as he was scaring princess Cocoa. She defended princess Cocoa saying she clearly needed the food and that she was obviously desperate. <q>I mean look at her!!!!</q> the young Cocoanian girl
    exclaimed while pointing at the princess and looking directly into Cocoa’s face. <blockquote>‘She is clearly poor! Look at her
    poor face, there is poverty written all over it and especially in those poor, miserable looking eyes of hers.’</blockquote>
       
    <p>Princess Cocoa froze. The ‘p’ word echoed in her head. She is clearly <q>POOR POOR POOR.</q>
    The princess’ hatred for her creckles reared its ugly head again. She thought, <q>If only I didn’t have
    these confounded creckles!!!!!!!</q> Nobody could see her ‘royal’ glow and now she looked like every other
    person in the Land. It turned her stomach. The princess was so astounded and shocked by the fact that
    someone had called her poor that she did not realise that her defender had managed to appease the angry
    man and was leading the princess out of the Crispmas market. The girl told princess Cocoa to head on home
    with all her Crispmas goods and to keep a low profile around the market for a bit. The young girl then
    disappeared into the hustle and bustle of the market crowd.</p>
       
    <p>Princess cocoa walked in a daze back towards the palace.
    The word ‘POOR’ echoed in Cocoa’s ears. She was not blinking, her body moved slowly and in a
    zombie like fashion. <img src="IMG/POOR.png" alt="image of Princess Cocoa disgusted at being called poor." style="float:left;width:300px;height:350px;"> It was like she was under some sort of spell. She was just half way up the palace garden path when the events of the day overcame her. Not only was the word <q>POOR</q> echoing in her head at maximum volume but she suddenly had a flashback of the young girl who saved her touching her shoulder. It replayed in her mind in slow motion. She felt the hand of this common girl on her shoulder. She had been touched by the common folk. She was completely overcome by disgust that she lost all ability to move and fainted there and then on the royal garden path.</p>
       
    <p>The princess woke to discover herself in bed in the Cool Room of the castle. The princess still had a
    stunned look on her face. <q>Ah!!!! You are awake.</q> She looked up and saw the royal choctor, who always had a ridiculous grin on his face no matter what news he was giving you, and her mother standing in front of her.
    <blockquote>‘You gave us quite the shock lying there on the front path but it’s ok you just have a bit of a fever. You must
    stay in the Cool Room until your temperature dies down, we don’t want you melting away on us now, do we?'</blockquote>
       
    <p>The choctor left the room laughing at his own joke while her mother stared at Cocoa and asked in a sympathetic tone, <q>How are you feeling my dear?</q> Princess Cocoa was still overcome by the fact that some common creature had called her <q>POOR</q> and touched her royal shoulder that she was stumped for words. She responded <q>p… p… p… p… poor… p… p… p… poor.</q> Her mother, not knowing what had happened, simply thought her daughter was trying to say that she felt poorly. Her mother replied, <blockquote>'Well you will be resting here for the next couple of days. Don’t try and strain yourself darling and most importantly DO NOT try and speak. I’ll come back and visit you in a bit,’</blockquote>  
       
    <p>Despite the princess’ p…p…protestations, the queen left. Princess Cocoa’s temperature disappeared after a couple of days like the choctor said however shewas still frozen in shock. She was still unable to speak. The only thing she could say was, <q>p… p… poor… p… p…poor.</q> Sufficed to say the palace was very quiet during that week. The royal grounds had never felt such peace
    since the birth of the princess and so everyone welcomed such quietness with extremely wide and open arms. Everyone, including Beanie Gwegooey the dog, were tremendously and unusually happy for those few days. Everyone except for Princess Cocoa, of course.</p>
